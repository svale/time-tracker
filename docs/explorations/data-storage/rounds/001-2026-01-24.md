# Round 1 - 2026-01-24

## 1. Data Criticality

Which data is most critical to never lose? Rank these:

- **Projects & their domain mappings** (user-created)
- **Settings/preferences** (user-configured)
- **Activity sessions** (auto-collected browsing data)
- **Calendar subscriptions** (user-added feeds)
- **Focus samples** (auto-collected, can be regenerated)

**Your answer:**
User-created since auto-collected usaaly can be re-collected.

## 2. Acceptable Complexity

The current sql.js approach is "zero dependencies" (no native modules, no external services). Which trade-offs are acceptable?

- **A) Stay zero-dependency** - Fix issues within current constraints
- **B) Native modules OK** - Can use better-sqlite3 (requires node-gyp/compilation)
- **C) External service OK** - Can run PostgreSQL locally
- **D) Cloud service OK** - Can use hosted database (Supabase, PlanetScale, etc.)

**Your answer:**
Both C and D are acceptable

## 3. Process Architecture

The current two-process design (daemon writes activity, server writes config) causes race conditions. Preferred approach?

- **A) Keep two processes** - Fix with file locking or IPC
- **B) Single process** - Merge daemon into server (always-running web server)
- **C) Database server** - Let PostgreSQL/SQLite handle concurrency
- **D) Message queue** - Daemon sends data to server via queue

**Your answer:**
I prefer C, but I eant you to make an educated research driven opinion

## 4. Future Platform Target

What's the most likely future direction?

- **A) Stay Node.js CLI/web** - Current architecture, maybe Electron later
- **B) Native macOS app** - Swift/SwiftUI with SQLite or Core Data
- **C) Cloud-hosted SaaS** - Multi-user, subscription model
- **D) Hybrid** - Local app with optional cloud sync

**Your answer:**
D. But this is not critical at this moment

## 5. Settings Storage Format

For user settings specifically, would you prefer:

- **A) Keep in SQLite** - Structured, queryable, but same loss issues
- **B) YAML file** - Human-readable, easy to backup/edit manually
- **C) JSON file** - Similar to YAML, more common in Node.js
- **D) macOS defaults** - Use `defaults` command / plist (native feel)

**Your answer:**
No strong feelings about this.  B or C seems good.

## 6. Data Location Preference

Where should user data live?

- **A) App directory** (`./data/`) - Current approach, portable
- **B) User's home** (`~/.time-tracker/`) - Standard for CLI tools
- **C) macOS Application Support** (`~/Library/Application Support/TimeTracker/`) - Native macOS convention
- **D) XDG standard** (`~/.local/share/time-tracker/`) - Linux-friendly

**Your answer:**
B

## 7. Immediate Priority

What's most important to fix first?

- **A) Stop data loss** - Any solution that prevents losing user data
- **B) Simplify architecture** - Reduce complexity that causes bugs
- **C) Future-proof** - Pick solution that scales to cloud/native
- **D) Quick fix** - Minimal changes to current code

**Your answer:**
A
