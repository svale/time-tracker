# Round 2 - 2026-01-15

## 1. Keyword Management Location

Where should users manage keywords for project-event matching?

**Options:**
- **Projects page**: Add a "Keywords" section next to "Domains" in each project card (consistent with domain mapping)
- **Settings page**: Separate "Calendar Keywords" section
- **Both**: Manage per-project on Projects page, view all on Settings

**Your answer:**
Projects page

## 2. Dashboard Manual Override UI

When viewing a calendar event on the dashboard, how should manual project assignment work?

**Options:**
- **Dropdown on hover/click**: Show project selector when interacting with event
- **Edit button**: Small edit icon that opens a modal/popover with project dropdown
- **Inline dropdown**: Always-visible project dropdown next to each event

**Your answer:**
Inline dropdown

## 3. Match Indicator

Should the UI show why an event was auto-assigned (which keyword matched)?

**Options:**
- **Yes, always**: Show matched keyword as tooltip or small label
- **Yes, on hover**: Show in tooltip only
- **No**: Just show the project assignment, users can figure it out

**Your answer:**
Yes, always

## 4. Keyword Priority/Ordering

Since "first match wins," how should keyword order be determined?

**Options:**
- **Creation order**: First-added keyword has highest priority
- **Alphabetical**: Simple, predictable
- **Manual drag-and-drop**: User controls priority explicitly
- **Doesn't matter much**: Keep it simple, creation order is fine

**Your answer:**
Doesn't matter much
