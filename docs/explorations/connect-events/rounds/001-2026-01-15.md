# Round 1 - 2026-01-15

## 1. Primary Assignment Method

How should calendar events be primarily connected to projects?

**Options:**
- **Keywords**: Match event title/description against project-specific keywords (e.g., "standup" → Work project)
- **Subscription-level**: Entire calendar subscriptions assigned to a project (e.g., "Work Calendar" → Work project)
- **Both**: Keywords for fine-grained matching, with subscription as fallback/default

**Your answer:**
Keywords

## 2. Keyword Matching Behavior

When using keywords, what text should be searched?

**Options:**
- Title only
- Title + description
- Title + description + location

And should matching be:
- Exact substring match (case-insensitive)
- Word boundary match (whole words only)
- Regex support

**Your answer:**
Title + description
You can choose the matching strategy you find best

## 3. Manual Override UI

Where should users be able to manually assign a calendar event to a project?

**Options:**
- On the dashboard/reports when viewing events
- On a dedicated calendar view page
- In the existing projects page
- All of the above

**Your answer:**
On the dashboard when viewing events

---

## 4. Subscription-Level Defaults

Should users be able to set a default project for an entire calendar subscription (all events from that calendar go to that project unless overridden)?

- Yes, useful for dedicated work/personal calendars
- No, only use keyword matching
- Optional feature (nice to have but not required)

**Your answer:**
No

---

## 5. Conflicting Assignments

If multiple keywords match (event belongs to multiple projects) or a keyword conflicts with a subscription default, how should this be handled?

**Options:**
- First match wins (keyword order matters)
- Most specific wins (keywords beat subscription default)
- Show warning and let user choose
- Allow multi-project assignment

**Your answer:**
First match wins

## 6. Re-processing Existing Events

When a user adds a new keyword or changes assignment rules, should existing events be re-processed?

- Yes, automatically re-match all events
- No, only apply to new events
- Ask the user each time

**Your answer:**
Yes, automatically re-match all events
