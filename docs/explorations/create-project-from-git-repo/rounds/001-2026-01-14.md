# Round 1 - 2026-01-14

## 1. Settings Page Location

Should the Git Repositories section be added to the existing Settings page, or would you prefer a dedicated "Integrations" or "Git" page?

Options:
- **Settings page** (alongside Calendar Subscriptions) - keeps all configuration in one place
- **New dedicated page** - cleaner separation but more navigation

**Your answer:**
"Git Repositories" are already listed on the Settings page (below Calendar Subscriptions). Please see http://localhost:8765/settings#:~:text=Git-,Repositories,-Track%20local%20git (use clude chtome extension)

## 2. Repository Display

What information should be shown for each tracked git repository?

Options:
- **Minimal**: Repo name + path + "Create Project" button
- **Detailed**: Repo name, path, last activity, commit count, current branch, assigned project (if any)
- **Other** (describe what you'd like to see)

**Your answer:**
Use the cards as they are now, but with the new "Create project" button

## 3. Create Project Behavior

When clicking "Create Project" on a repo, what should happen?

Options:
- **Instant creation**: Create project immediately with repo name as project name, default color, auto-link repo
- **Modal form**: Open the existing "New Project" modal pre-filled with repo name, let user customize before saving
- **Other** (describe)

**Your answer:**
Use the modal form, please. With pre-filled repo name. The color selctor should be randomized by default (also for the normal new project modal)

## 4. Existing Projects

Should there also be an option to link a repo to an *existing* project (not just create new)?

Options:
- **Yes**: Dropdown to select existing project + "Create New" button
- **No**: Just "Create Project" for simplicity (user can manually assign in Projects page)
- **Both**: Primary action is "Create Project", but show "Link to Existing" as secondary option

**Your answer:**
Yes. This dropdown allready exists. Kepp it
