## 2. Day Label Format

You want "Today" and "Yesterday" to show like other days (name + date). What format?

- **C)** Keep special text but add date: "Today (Wed 15/1)" or two lines
- **D)** Just day name + number: `Wed 15` (no month)

## 3. URL Query Parameter

For sharing/refreshing, we'll add `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` to the URL. Should browser back/forward buttons navigate through date history?

- **B)** No - use `replaceState` so URL updates but no history entries created
